console.log(this) in server.js gives use  empty object {}

npm init gives us package.json it is a configuration files contains data about 
dependencies

blocking - non blocking operations

url-->uniform resource locator

https--> secure means it encrypts the user request 
http--> dont secure the user request

diff btw express and nodejs
1. in node we need to handle routes with switch cases and also handle post methods 
with get,put,post,patch we need be everything from scratch
2. in node to work with query parameetrs we generakly do importing url module and 
need to parse it adn acces the query parameetrs
3. we need to import https moudle adn create server 

1. in express we dont need handle to routes manual instead on app project we gebarrly have http metyods
from which we geberaly handle routes
2. in express to handle query parameters dont need to require url modles and parse the req.url 
instead we can acces url easly with req.query.queryProperty
3. dont need to import https module and create server insteaed we directly listen the user requests 
on app object itself like app.listen(8000,()=>console.log("Seever is losstning..."))
